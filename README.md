# Some practical tools for Econometrics and Regression
> This repository is inspired by a project in course **Financial Asset Pricing** in this semester.

## For whom?

This repository is for those who are interested in **econometrics** and **regression analysis**. 

`my_utils` is my temporary toolbox. It contains some practical tools to 
- combine *regression results* and *p-values* into a table
- transfer `pd.DataFrame` to `LaTeX` code of tables

## data-examples

The directories `factor_result` and `regression_result` constain data about my **Fama-french five factors model** project.
- `factor_result`: the results of factors
- `regression_result`: the results of regression

Here, they are just some examples for test which everybody can use.
